# odin-recipes
A webpage of simple recipes.
I put to practice what I've been studying (HTML, GIT, GITHUB and PowerShell). I had fun following the instructions on how to build the HTML structure, finding the perfect pictures, linking the pages.
I had trouble commiting throught PowerShell and I realised I need to practice this part more.
I expect to makes some tweaks to the HTML to be able to add style and create a cohesive layout.
